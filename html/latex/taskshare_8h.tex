\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Data which can be shared between tasks in a thread-\/safe manner. 

This file contains a template class for data which is to be shared between tasks. The data must be protected against damage due to context switches, so it is protected by a mutex or by causing transfers to take place inside critical sections of code which are not interrupted.
